# This file contains the configuration file skeleton I would like to adapt to.

# Database implications:
# Sessions will have binds of their own.
# More complex connection between simulation runs and parameter sets.

# Code implications:
# Simulation construction will have to build objects from session binds.
# Mesh controller will be slightly altered to deal with new run/experiment.
# Probably need a way to get analyses from run for a given experiment.

# For now we can assume a mesh parameter spec.
