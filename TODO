Immediate concerns:
    Pick goodness of fit metric.
        chi^2
        2 * (a-b)^2 / ((a + b) * std)

    Make some visualization aids.
        2d chi^2 surface

        way to slice based on parameter values/ranges
        print the values of a specific parameter used in the file

        get good color scheme
        prettify 1d chi^2 plot


Broken Windows:
    Clean up HDF io so that measurement reads/writes are consistent with
        my preferred style.


Usability:
    Add start message to console.py
        Needs to have some basic help.


Enhancements:
    Use multiprocess.Pool for the common analysis.
        * This is becoming a big deal.  Analysis takes longer than sim.
            The problem is that this appears to be io limited.
            Basically using HDF may be seriously handicapping me.
    Link parameters to analysis from simulations.
        Requires newer version of pytables.


Simulations to Run:
    pollard:
        fluorescence/length for range of polymerization rates
            * need sensitivity eventually
        fluorescence/length for range of filament tip concentrations

        length, pi for various cooperativities and cleavage rates
            need chi^2 plots for this
