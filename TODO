[ --- Immediate Steps --- ] 

to code/configure:
    depolymerization bulk pyrene stuff
        (done) disable transitions at concentration threshold
        (done) configuration files
        (done) run with flat pyrene coefs
        (not now) floating fit (for chi^2 v rho curve)
            2 free parameters (* scale, + background) & time adjustment
        
        (not now) try it with 4 state random model?

to explore:
    make sure that large rho depoly timecourses look like vectorial
    (not now) run pyrene depoly sim with large num filaments per sim
        statistical spread may explain bulk depoly timecourse

to run:
    fit melki rates for lots of cooperativities
    fnc variation sims for a few rhos
    depoly timecourse sims for (rho 1, 1000, vectorial) for both par sets
    copoly sims for power of 10 rhos
    pi variation sims for all rhos
    tagged pi variation sims for (all) rhos

to write:
    sections:
        intro
        analysis of past experiments
        proposed experiments
        conclusions/discussion

    extend results
    make sure global fit discussion says "bulk and single-filament data"

    everything else

[ --- First paper goals --- ]

*error estimation
    - make sure the SEM new model is a o k
        * are we doing concentration SEMs right? (there is not std per run)

    - figure out how to calculate the error in the halftime
        SEM of [Pi] / d[Pi]/dt @ [Pi] halftime
            average SEM of containing points
        * check that this works
            e.g. regenerate melki random timecourse timecourse

    - propagate error estimate to rate
        SEM of halftime / sensitivity
        

*halftime sensitivity (various cooperativities)
    propagate error estimate


rate - cooperativity relationship (from melki)


fnc variation
    - use carlier86 conditions
    - show carlier86 points
    - show random, vectorial, carlier86 "bounding"/fitting cooperative traces
    + carlier86 halftime is 1000s
        is it simply the FNC & [G-actin]?
        is this because of nucleation?
        is there a problem with the experiment?


*depolymerization timecourse/profile (recent carlier)
    - plot data + lots of light single filament traces
    - plot chi^2 fit to pyrene time courses vs rho
        fit figure 2D of 2011 data with Frank's pyrene coefficients
        be sure to look at individual pyrene timecourses


copoly spread
    - add P & W points (to see how they look)


pi variation


[ --- Framework Thoughts --- ]

Missing features:
    nucleation, filament deletion, severing, and annealing
    "multi-stage" simulations
    derived parameters
    monitoring/completion estimates
    job continuation/extension (more stats or restarting)
        also easy additional analysis on previous sims

Misc problems/thoughts:
    it's probably reasonable to store much more data than I am now
    visualization/analysis code is kind of terrible
        perhaps it should be thought of as more ad hoc, with the core
            framework only generating actually timecourses?

Key components:
    - job control
        track live/zombie processes (make procs logout on any exception)
    - algorithm
    - data storage
        store much more data (full, individual runs)
            should these be zipped streams in the DB?
    - configuration
        controller selection from config file?
        good validation
    - analysis & results
        better framework for this
    - fitting/job selection
    - visualization
    - monitoring
        predict job completion
        ?email/sms

    - misc automation

Other shiny things:
    require worker code revision to match controller code revision
        (have setting to require clean/no modifications?)
    get delete cascading correct

[ ------------------------- ]

delete unused visualization code

Fix up database cascading.

Add database constraints for 1 or more experiments per session, runs per experiment?

Add validation for config files (separate program to check file set).
    Pretty sure most of this code exists in main branch.
