For Talk:
    "basic" plots
        1d chi squared plots
            (fit sensitivity plots)

        chi squared surface plots

    "assembled" plots
        duplicate pollard fit without pyrene correction
        sensivity to parameters for simple random model
        corrolation plots

    infrastructure
        make a summary table for each group contianing parameters and values


Validation:
    automate some higher level tests
        analytic vs my run
    Analysis code needs more unit tests.


BUGS:
    Is there a problem with the single random simulation?
        a pyrene sim looked oddly low for first 2 data points.
            have not been able to duplicate.


Visualization:
    Refactor Theme to only contain color and linestyle/width info.
    Visualization for short time stuff.
    extend reduction plots for 4 hydrolysis parameters
