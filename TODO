factories - these are important, they decouple the primitives from the DB
    analysis result
    objective result

controller process
    make sure the mesh process/run_job is running on a nice big mesh for the
            objectives
        * is it time to just separate objective and run jobs?
            each objective job could prance across all runs for a given par set
        
    global fit mechanism
        do some kind of coarse mesh/random to start
        then start generating children

database structure
    validation rules (e.g. for bind module_names)
    cascading deletes/orphans

visualization
    holy balls this will be better with better internal structure
    still going to need to create temporary/summary tables

Do some vocab/docs
    session
    run
    job
    primitive
    bind
    analysis
    objective
    simulation
    stage - just slang?
    ? slice
    ? projection
