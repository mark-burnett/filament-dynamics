goals for wednesday:
    logging - this shouldn't be too hard and could be really valuable.
    reproduce a simple pollard sim with the new backend
    visible progress on p & w
        at least random model with fluorescence weights against all 3 results



factories - these are important, they decouple the primitives from the DB
    analysis result
    objective result

logging
    is it time to add logging support?
    will need to be able to dump the db log to stdout for easy viewing.
        perhaps a `tail -f` log dumper?

controller process
    make sure the mesh process/run_job is running on a nice big mesh for the
            objectives
        * is it time to just separate objective and run jobs?
            each objective job could prance across all runs for a given par set

    register conteroller process & attach to each job as creator

    global fit mechanism
        do some kind of coarse mesh/random to start
        then start generating children

database structure
    validation rules (e.g. for bind module_names)
    cascading deletes/orphans

visualization
    holy balls this will be better with better internal structure
    still going to need to create temporary/summary tables

Do some vocab/docs
    session
    run
    job
    primitive
    bind
    analysis
    objective
    simulation
    stage - just slang?
    ? slice
    ? projection
