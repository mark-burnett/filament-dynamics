Immediate concerns:
    Decide on error analysis.
        standard error of the mean for bulk things
            N = # filaments for filament measurements
            N = # simulations for concentration measurements

    Make some visualization aids.
        prettify 1d chi^2 plot
        2d chi^2 surface
        way to slice based on parameter values/ranges
        print the values of a specific parameter used in the file



Broken Windows:
    analysis and visualization utils mismatch
        merge into analysis, better separate,
            or pull out of both into separate area
    Clean up HDF io so that measurement reads/writes are consistent with
        my preferred style.


Usability:
    Add start message to console.py


Enhancements:
    Use multiprocess.Pool for the common analysis.
    Link parameters to analysis from simulations.
        Requires newer version of pytables.


Simulations to Run:
    pollard:
        fluorescence/length for range of polymerization rates
            * need sensitivity eventually
        fluorescence/length for range of filament tip concentrations

        length, pi for various cooperativities and cleavage rates
            need chi^2 plots for this
