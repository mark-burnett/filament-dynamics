Things to Automate:
    fitting:
        fit fluorescence normalization
        chi^2 vs single arbitrary parameter
        chi^2 surface plot vs 2 parameters

Simulations to Run:
    pollard:
        fluorescence/length for range of polymerization rates
            * need sensitivity eventually
        fluorescence/length for range of filament tip concentrations

        length, pi for various cooperativities and cleavage rates
            need chi^2 plots for this

Other things to worry about:
    error estimates
