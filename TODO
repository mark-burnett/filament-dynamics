goals for wednesday:
    logging - this shouldn't be too hard and could be really valuable.
    reproduce a simple pollard sim with the new backend
    visible progress on p & w
        at least random model with fluorescence weights against all 3 results


visualization
    make sure the old visualization code is brought up to speed
    add useful amount of theme management?

testing
    need input validation for yaml files
        * super important, because input bugs are tricky
    need tests for some of this new code.

process utils
    list active processes
    close processes
    list # active jobs, awaiting jobs, etc. (general job status)
    report run times for each job

log viewer
    no color option (for file dumping)
    default start time of -2 min or something
        or perhaps last N entries?
    try db_session.expire_all() instead of grabbing a new session on refresh

sim.sh
    integrate better log viewing options


performance profiling
    record job start/stop times


controller process
    global fit mechanism
        do some kind of coarse mesh/random to start
        then start generating children
        *** NOTE This is unlikely to be useful for the first paper.


Do some vocab/docs
    session
    run
    job
    primitive
    bind
    analysis
    objective
    simulation
    stage - just slang?
    ? slice
    ? projection
