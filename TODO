goals for thursday:
    ? reproduce a simple pollard sim with the new backend
    progress on p & w
        visual spreads for all 3 experiments


goals for end of march:
    pollard analysis (done)
    pieper & wegner analysis
    tip diffusion analysis
        fit data/standard analysis
        tip diffusion coefficient as function of concentration


visualization - high priority
    make sure the old visualization code is brought up to speed
    add useful amount of theme management?

    check slice fixed points against mesh values to make sure they match


testing - high priority
    need input validation for yaml files
        * super important, because input bugs are tricky
    unit testing opportunities
        input code
        configuration building code
        factory code


configuration - medium priority
    *** allow more "global" like config, e.g. sesion binds or something.
        think about pieper & wegner..3 experiments with only 2 differences.
    validation for config files

performance profiling - medium priority
    record job start/stop times



process utils - low priority
    list active processes
    close processes
    list # active jobs, awaiting jobs, etc. (general job status)
    report run times for each job


sim.sh - low priority
    integrate better log viewing options


Do some vocab/docs - low priority
    session
    run
    job
    primitive
    bind
    analysis
    objective
    simulation
    stage - just slang?
    ? slice
    ? projection


controller process - very low priority
    global fit mechanism
        do some kind of coarse mesh/random to start
        then start generating children
        *** NOTE This is unlikely to be useful for the first paper.
