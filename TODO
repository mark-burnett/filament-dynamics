goals for wednesday:
    reproduce a simple pollard sim with the new backend
    visible progress on p & w
        at least random model with fluorescence weights against all 3 results

goals for end of march:
    pollard analysis (done)
    pieper & wegner analysis
    tip diffusion analysis
        fit data/standard analysis
        tip diffusion coefficient as function of concentration


configuration
    *** allow more "global" like config, e.g. sesion binds or something.
        think about pieper & wegner..3 experiments with only 2 differences.
    validation for config files

visualization
    make sure the old visualization code is brought up to speed
    add useful amount of theme management?

    check slice fixed points against mesh values to make sure they match

testing
    need input validation for yaml files
        * super important, because input bugs are tricky
    need tests for some of this new code.

process utils
    list active processes
    close processes
    list # active jobs, awaiting jobs, etc. (general job status)
    report run times for each job

log viewer
    no color option (for file dumping)
    default start time of -2 min or something
        or perhaps last N entries?

sim.sh
    integrate better log viewing options


performance profiling
    record job start/stop times


controller process
    global fit mechanism
        do some kind of coarse mesh/random to start
        then start generating children
        *** NOTE This is unlikely to be useful for the first paper.


Do some vocab/docs
    session
    run
    job
    primitive
    bind
    analysis
    objective
    simulation
    stage - just slang?
    ? slice
    ? projection
