For Talk:
    "basic" plots
        1d chi squared plots
            (fit sensitivity plots)

        chi squared surface plots

    "assembled" plots
        duplicate pollard fit without pyrene correction
        sensivity to parameters for simple random model

Validation:
    automate some higher level tests
        analytic vs my run
    Analysis code needs more unit tests.


BUGS:
    Is there a problem with the single random simulation?
        a pyrene sim looked oddly low for first 2 data points.
            have not been able to duplicate.


Visualization:
    Visualization for short time stuff.
    extend reduction plots for 4 hydrolysis parameters
