goals for Tuesday
    P&W preliminary analysis


goals for end of march:
    pollard analysis (done)
    pieper & wegner analysis
    tip diffusion analysis
        fit data/standard analysis
        tip diffusion coefficient as function of concentration


visualization - high priority
    make bulk plotting functions that plot a whole session


validation - high priority
    need input validation for yaml files
        * important, because input bugs are tricky
        check for missing parameters
        check for unrecognized keys (like 'model' instead of 'models')
    unit testing opportunities
        input code
        configuration building code
        factory code


configuration - medium-high priority
    allow more "global" like config, e.g. sesion binds or something.
        think about pieper & wegner..3 experiments with only 2 differences.
    validation for config files



performance profiling - medium priority
    record job start/stop times


process utils - low priority
    list active processes
    close processes
    list # active jobs, awaiting jobs, etc. (general job status)
    report run times for each job
    estimate remaining run time from session start time # jobs complete, etc


database - low priority
    set appropriate cascades for deletes
        it's going to be hard to keep the db clean without this


sim.sh - low priority
    integrate better log viewing options


Do some vocab/docs - low priority
    session
    run
    job
    primitive
    bind
    analysis
    objective
    simulation
    stage - just slang?
    ? slice
    ? projection


controller process - very low priority
    global fit mechanism
        do some kind of coarse mesh/random to start
        then start generating children
        *** NOTE This is unlikely to be useful for the first paper.
