Immediate concerns:
    Pick goodness of fit metric.
        chi^2
        2 * (a-b)^2 / ((a + b) * std)

    Make some visualization aids.
        get good color scheme
        prettify 1d chi^2 plot
        prettify 2d chi^2 plot

    To have big runs, I need to deal with the 8gb memory issue.
        This should probably be combined with pypy adoption.


Broken Windows:
    Cleaner visualization code.


Usability:
    Add start message to console.py
        Needs to have some basic help.

Validation:
    Analysis code has no unit tests (it's only tested manually).


Enhancements:
    Look into PyPy for cli.py
        replace multiprocess module with a script that runs multiple instances.
        perform analysis, combine output files.


Simulations to Run:
    pollard:
        fluorescence/length for range of polymerization rates
            * need sensitivity eventually
        fluorescence/length for range of filament tip concentrations

        length, pi for various cooperativities and cleavage rates
            need chi^2 plots for this
