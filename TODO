goals for thursday:
    ? reproduce a simple pollard sim with the new backend
    progress on p & w
        visual spreads for all 3 experiments

steps for thursday:
    update (verbose) configurations
        each experiment has 3 objectives
            flat fluorescence
            brooks fluorescence
            pi
        random model
        cooperative model
    visualize
        for each experiment
            fluorescences vs filament tip concentration
            Pi fit as contour and individually in both dimensions
        combined
            pick best ftc for each experiment
            use that to slice the Pi fit
            add those Pi chi**2's
            plot contour and individually
    write code that does the whole visualization set


goals for end of march:
    pollard analysis (done)
    pieper & wegner analysis
    tip diffusion analysis
        fit data/standard analysis
        tip diffusion coefficient as function of concentration


visualization - high priority
    make bulk plotting functions that plot a whole session
    make sure the old visualization code is brought up to speed

    check slice fixed points against mesh values to make sure they match


validation - high priority
    need input validation for yaml files
        * important, because input bugs are tricky
        check for missing parameters
        check for unrecognized keys (like 'model' instead of 'models')
    unit testing opportunities
        input code
        configuration building code
        factory code


configuration - medium-high priority
    allow more "global" like config, e.g. sesion binds or something.
        think about pieper & wegner..3 experiments with only 2 differences.
    * this would allow us to have a 'constants' file we could import
        would include e.g. standard/fujiwara rates or frank's coefficients
    validation for config files


performance profiling - medium priority
    record job start/stop times



process utils - low priority
    list active processes
    close processes
    list # active jobs, awaiting jobs, etc. (general job status)
    report run times for each job


sim.sh - low priority
    integrate better log viewing options


Do some vocab/docs - low priority
    session
    run
    job
    primitive
    bind
    analysis
    objective
    simulation
    stage - just slang?
    ? slice
    ? projection


controller process - very low priority
    global fit mechanism
        do some kind of coarse mesh/random to start
        then start generating children
        *** NOTE This is unlikely to be useful for the first paper.
