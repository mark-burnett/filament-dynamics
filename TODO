Immediate concerns:
    Pick goodness of fit metric.
        chi^2
        2 * (a-b)^2 / ((a + b) * std)

    Make some visualization aids.
        2d chi^2 surface

        way to slice based on parameter values/ranges
        print the values of a specific parameter used in the file

        get good color scheme
        prettify 1d chi^2 plot


Broken Windows:
    Consider performing common analysis immediately and only saving that.


Usability:
    Add start message to console.py
        Needs to have some basic help.


Enhancements:
    Use multiprocess.Pool for the common analysis.
        * This is becoming a big deal.  Analysis takes longer than sim.
            The problem is that this appears to be io limited.
            Basically using HDF may be seriously handicapping me.
    Look into PyPy for cli.py
        replace multiprocess module with a script that runs multiple instances.
        perform analysis, combine output files.


Simulations to Run:
    pollard:
        fluorescence/length for range of polymerization rates
            * need sensitivity eventually
        fluorescence/length for range of filament tip concentrations

        length, pi for various cooperativities and cleavage rates
            need chi^2 plots for this
