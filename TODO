Broken Windows:
    Cleaner visualization code.
    rename/refactor file mp_support.py - there is no longer mp support o.O


BUGS:
    Is there a problem with the single random simulation?
        pyrene sim looks oddly low for first 2 data points somehow.


Usability:
    Add start message to console.py
        Needs to have some basic help.


Validation:
    Analysis code has no unit tests (it's only tested manually).


Enhancements:
    Better way of splitting parameters into multiple runs.
