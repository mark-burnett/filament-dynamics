immediate stuff
    write worker loop
    make analysis & objective primitives/code

analysis & objective
    registration
    total refactor

controller process
    mesh mechanism
        interleave:
            populate session/experiment/run hierarchy
            create jobs
    global fit mechanism
        do some kind of coarse mesh/random to start
        then start generating children

worker processes
    write the loop with timeout support

database structure
    add revision # for session controller
        for full provinance we need to know the worker-uuid + revision to
    validation rules (e.g. for bind module_names)
    cascading deletes/orphans

visualization
    holy balls this will be better with better internal structure
    still going to need to create temporary/summary tables

Do some vocab/docs
    session
    run
    job
    primitive
    bind
    analysis
    objective
    simulation
    stage - just slang?
    ? slice
    ? projection
