Make some visualization aids.
    full plot of a single parameter set
        include everything
        allow parameter labels
            ftc, etc
    prettify 1d chi^2 plot
    2d chi^2 surface

Clean up HDF io so that measurement reads/writes are consistent with
    my preferred style.

Clean up downsample analysis so that it uses the interpolation module.

Add start message to console.py


Simulations to Run:
    pollard:
        fluorescence/length for range of polymerization rates
            * need sensitivity eventually
        fluorescence/length for range of filament tip concentrations

        length, pi for various cooperativities and cleavage rates
            need chi^2 plots for this
