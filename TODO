Immediate concerns:
    Interpolation for downsampling looks bad for last data point.
        Add previous value interpolation for data downsampling.

    Pick goodness of fit metric.
        chi^2
        2 * (a-b)^2 / ((a + b) * std)

    Make some visualization aids.
        get good color scheme
        prettify 1d chi^2 plot
        2d chi^2 surface
        way to slice based on parameter values/ranges
        print the values of a specific parameter used in the file



Broken Windows:
    Clean up HDF io so that measurement reads/writes are consistent with
        my preferred style.


Usability:
    Add start message to console.py
        Needs to have some basic help.
    Consider using hdf_file as a global in analysis and visualization code.


Enhancements:
    Use multiprocess.Pool for the common analysis.
        * This is becoming a big deal.  Analysis takes longer than sim.
    Link parameters to analysis from simulations.
        Requires newer version of pytables.


Simulations to Run:
    pollard:
        fluorescence/length for range of polymerization rates
            * need sensitivity eventually
        fluorescence/length for range of filament tip concentrations

        length, pi for various cooperativities and cleavage rates
            need chi^2 plots for this
