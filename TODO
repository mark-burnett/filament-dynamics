*error estimation

*halftime sensitivity (various cooperativities)
    propagate error estimate

rate - cooperativity relationship (from melki)

fnc variation
    - show raw and normalized (with carlier86 points) by random variation

*depolymerization timecourse/profile (recent carlier)
    - this probably doesn't exclude many models

copoly spread
    - show normalized by random -> add P & W points (normalized by average)

?pi variation
    - seems tacked on

[ ------------------------- ]

delete unused visualization code

Fix up database cascading.

Add database constraints for 1 or more experiments per session, runs per experiment?

Add validation for config files (separate program to check file set).
    Pretty sure most of this code exists in main branch.
