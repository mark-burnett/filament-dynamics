Reorganize configuration files:
    parameters should have some index-like files:
        bulk -> imports all the bulk parameters
    models should have more useful add on stuff:
        bulk -> imports all the bulk components

delete unused configuration
    (this is supposed to be the stuff that reproduces the paper)


Make meshes end on the correct point.

Make sure that we are sampling these simulations fast enough
    i.e. 30 second release halftime sampled at 5 seconds is not good enough.

Fix up database cascading.
