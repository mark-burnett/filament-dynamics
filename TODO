[ --- Framework Thoughts --- ]

Missing features:
    nucleation, filament deletion, severing, and annealing
    "multi-stage" simulations
    derived parameters (e.g. volume)
    monitoring/completion estimates
    job continuation/extension (more stats or restarting)
        also easy additional analysis on previous sims

Misc problems/thoughts:
    visualization/analysis code is kind of terrible
        perhaps it should be thought of as more ad hoc, with the core
            framework only generating actual timecourses?

Key components:
    - job control
        track live/zombie processes (make procs logout on any exception)
    - algorithm
    - data storage
        store much more data (full, individual runs)
            should these be zipped streams in the DB?
    - configuration
        controller selection from config file?
        good validation
    - analysis & results
        better framework for this
    - fitting/job selection
    - visualization
    - monitoring
        predict job completion
        ?email/sms

    - misc automation

Other shiny things:
    require worker code revision to match controller code revision
        (have setting to require clean/no modifications?)
    get delete cascading correct
