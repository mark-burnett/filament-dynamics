Validation:
    automate some higher level tests
        analytic vs my run
    Analysis code needs more unit tests.


BUGS:
    Is there a problem with the single random simulation?
        pyrene sim looks oddly low for first 2 data points somehow.


Visualization:
    Visualization for short time stuff.
    fitness vector vs atp_weight (with labels)
    extend reduction plots for 4 hydrolysis parameters


Broken Windows:
    Cleaner visualization code.
