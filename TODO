session
    ability to restart/continue
        this is basically automatic...

analysis & objective
    registration
    total refactor

controller process
    read yaml files
    parameter value determination is dealt with here
    mesh mechanism
        interleave:
            populate session/experiment/run hierarchy
            create jobs
    global fit mechanism
        do some kind of coarse mesh/random to start
        then start generating children

worker processes
    generate uuid on startup
    no contact with any files except database.ini
    command line arguments for:
        sleep time for job table empty
        sleep time for collision on getting job
        idle time before exit
        db config file name

configuration management
    database session/etc

database structure
    add revision # for session controller
        for full provinance we need to know the worker-uuid + revision to
    validation rules (e.g. for bind module_names)
    cascading deletes/orphans

visualization
    holy balls this will be better with better internal structure
    still going to need to create temporary/summary tables

Do some vocab/docs
    session
    run
    job
    primitive
    bind
    analysis
    objective
    simulation
    stage - just slang?
    ? slice
    ? projection
