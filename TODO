goals for wednesday:
    logging - this shouldn't be too hard and could be really valuable.
    reproduce a simple pollard sim with the new backend
    visible progress on p & w
        at least random model with fluorescence weights against all 3 results


controller process
    is it time to just separate objective and run jobs?
        each objective job could prance across all runs for a given par set

    global fit mechanism
        do some kind of coarse mesh/random to start
        then start generating children

database structure
    validation rules (e.g. for bind module_names)
    cascading deletes/orphans

visualization
    holy balls this will be better with better internal structure
    still going to need to create temporary/summary tables

Do some vocab/docs
    session
    run
    job
    primitive
    bind
    analysis
    objective
    simulation
    stage - just slang?
    ? slice
    ? projection
